AI/ML x Biochemistry | Builder | Research-Driven

Iâ€™m a Biochemistry major obsessed with scalable intelligenceâ€”-human, artificial, or otherwise. Using this space to prototype tools at the intersection of machine learning, biology, and automation.

### What I'm Doing
- Training and dissecting LLMs for domain-specific reasoning
- Exploring ML-integrated wet lab workflows
- Reverse-engineering scientific intuition into code
- Building from first principles, even when it's slower

### Repos That Matter
- [`foundations`](https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/foundations): My sandbox for Python, ML, and experimentation.
- [`labframe`](https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/labframe): AI-powered tools for molecular science.
- [`neurite`](https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/neurite): ML experiments + generative model workflows.

### Long-Term Vision
Research that propagates. Tools that scale. Systems that think. Products that matter.
